# 🗃 Dividing images into folders using EfficientNet V2 feature extracting

> ☣ **Warning:** This project was created during my studies for educational purposes only. It may contain non-optimal or outdated solutions.

### 📝 About
The program allows you to **divide your images into folders** according to the abstract features with the help of **EfficientNet V2** feature extracting. Of course, it works with a certain accuracy. After the first feature extracting, there is no need to repeat this procedure again, since it is possible to write/read features to/from the file *imgFeatures.bin*
